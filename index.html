                        My name is Medric A Riley. I was born in Sacramento, CA, and have lived in Davis, CA, 
                        ever since. After graduating from Leonardo Da Vinci Charter Academy in 2011, I decided
                        to try my hand at higher education, and enrolled at Sacramento City College. As it turns
                        out, I did not possess the focus to excel in college at the time, and after two years I 
                            decided to take a break, and focus on building my work experience.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        After two years of working odd jobs, I decided that it was time for me to go back to college.
                        I re-enrolled at Sacramento City, and on a whim, decided to take an intro to programming course.
                        I can still remember being completely enthralled by the material, and by the end of that 90 minute
                        session, I had found my major.

                    <br>
                    <p>
                        It was at this time that I got the job that I worked for the next four years. I began working at a 
                        restaurant in my hometown of Davis, and over the course of those four years moved from bussing, 
                        to being the expo, to serving, to finally bartending. While I can't say that I've loved every moment of this job, it has been a very formative experience for me, and has taught
                        me skills which include customer interaction, multi-tasking, conflict resolution, and 
                        working effectively with others.
